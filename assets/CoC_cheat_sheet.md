- ### **The Combat Round: Core Flow**
  
	1. **Declaration of Intent:** The Keeper asks, "What is your character doing?" Players should describe their actions narratively (e.g., "I'm trying to knock the gun out of his hand") rather than using game terms. The Keeper then determines the appropriate action and skill roll.
	2. **Establish Order of Attack:** Combatants act in order of their DEX (Dexterity) characteristic, from highest to lowest.
		* **Readied Firearms:** A character with a firearm already drawn and aimed may act at **DEX + 50** in the initiative order.
